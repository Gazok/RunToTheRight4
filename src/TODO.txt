not sure what theme/style we're going with, but it needs to be established so music/sfx/graphics/style is consistent if you get what I mean
Going to try and give it an "action hero"-y feel, planning to add explosions which happen all the way on then left edge of the screen, to make it look like you're running away from explosions (naturally, without looking at them)
Name and title screen stuff could (and should, I feel) be discussed on Wednesday, if someone makes a title menu with placeholder graphics, it will be easy to replace them after coming to a conclusion

misc
----
	- somehow explain controls to player
	- perhaps put our names on a credits screen
	- make preloader automatically go to start screen on finish loading
	- hide debug console when finished

graphics
--------
	- Ben: make a little fern sprite, unless Jamie wants to
	- maybe add dirt particles behind the player
	- Make the _backgroundThree images follow the camera, but at a lower speed, to simulate distance
		(This is at the bottom of Game's update() function)
	
gameplay
--------
	- Jack: make "press space" message flash on start/death screens
	- Jack: devise and implement some gameplay element with aliens
	- Jamie: add ferns which slightly slow down the player

audio
-----
	- Ben: add some kind of death sound effect
	- Jack: add volume toggle button (also triggered by M key)?
