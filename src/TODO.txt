not sure what theme/style we're going with, but it needs to be established so music/sfx/graphics/style is consistent if you get what I mean
Going to try and give it an "action hero"-y feel, planning to add explosions which happen all the way on then left edge of the screen, to make it look like you're running away from explosions (naturally, without looking at them)
Name and title screen stuff could (and should, I feel) be discussed on Wednesday, if someone makes a title menu with placeholder graphics, it will be easy to replace them after coming to a conclusion

- make title screen nicer
- explain controls to player: Space to jump

- make preloader automatically go to start screen on finish loading
- hide debug console when finished

graphics
--------
	- colours are being replaced by ones from the colour pallette I'm (Ben) using
	- add scrolling background (different graphical elements with varying graphic.scrollX)
	- add functioning explosions (dunno if Jamie or Ben should code this)
	
gameplay
--------
	- seems like it's a little too fast-paced too quickly?
	- add (nicer) death and restart system
	- base wall spawn position on possibility of jump from last wall
	- Some jumps are impossible. Recommend giving greater jumps, but making gaps between walls longer (width, not height)
	- add some kind of novel mechanic(s) so it isn't the same old boring canabalt rip-off:
		- some kind of walking enemies to jump over/slap?
		- perhaps a super-jump (could be represented as swinging up and climbing rope) - ropes could be pick-up-able (start with 1, can hold max 3)
		- some kind of randomly postioned fence on some walls which the player has to jump over

audio
-----
	- add non-annoying jump sound effect
	- add some kind of death sound effect
	- add volume toggle button (also triggered by M key)?
