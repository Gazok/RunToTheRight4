not sure what theme/style we're going with, but it needs to be established
so music/sfx/graphics/style is consistent if you get what I mean

- name game
- make title screen
- explain controls to player

graphics
--------
	- A basic character model has been made, with placeholder leg animations
	- Colours are being replaced by ones from the colour pallette I'm (Ben) using
	- add scrolling background (at half Game.speed)
	- the character should probably bob his head; he looks like he's skating
	
gameplay
--------
	- add (nicer) death and restart system
	- stop player from getting stuck in side of walls
	- stop player from exiting left/right of screen
	
	- add some kind of novel mechanic(s) so it isn't the same old boring canabalt rip-off:
		- perhaps a super-jump (could be represented as swinging up and climbing rope) - ropes could be pick-up-able (start with 1, can hold max 3)
		- some kind of randomly postioned fence on some walls which the player has to jump over

audio
-----
	- add bg music
	- add non-annoying jump sound effect

	- add volume toggle button (also triggered by M key)?
