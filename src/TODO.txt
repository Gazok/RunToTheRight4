not sure what theme/style we're going with , but it needs to be established
so music/sfx/graphics/style is consistent if you get what I mean

- name game
- make title screen

graphics
--------
	- A basic character model has been made, with placeholder leg animations
	- Colours are being replaced by ones from the colour pallette I'm (Ben) using
	- add scrolling background (at half wall speed)
	- the character should probably bob his head; he looks like he's skating
	
gameplay
--------
	- add scoring system based on time survived
	- add (nicer) death and restart system
	- make walls randomly variable in:
		- length
		- gap between
		- height
	- make platforms begin by moving slowly and gradually speed up
	- stop player from getting stuck in side of walls
	- stop player from exiting left/right of screen
	
	- add some kind of novel mechanic so it isn't the same old boring canabalt rip-off

audio
-----
	- add bg music
	- add non-annoying jump sound effect

	- add volume toggle button (also triggered by M key)?
