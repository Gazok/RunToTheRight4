- add art
	A basic character model has been made, with placeholder leg animations
	Colours are being replaced by ones from the colour pallette I'm (Ben) using
- make platforms move to the side
	1) Move all instances of walls and the left (1 pixel?)
	2) If there are no walls in the way, move the player back into his initial position
	3) Delete walls which are too far off the edge
- make platforms generate
- add scoring system based on time survived
- add death and restart system


Testing the fuck out of my branch yo.
